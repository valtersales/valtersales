## Hi there üëã! I'm Valter Sales

## üíº Summary

I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer with strong expertise in Java (Spring Framework) and Python (APIs and AI applications), building robust and scalable solutions for real-world challenges. My experience spans backend and frontend development, database design, and cloud-based architectures, always with a focus on performance, maintainability, and user impact.

In addition to my solid background in software engineering, I bring a complementary expertise in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, applying data-driven approaches and machine learning models to create intelligent and efficient applications. This combination allows me to deliver solutions that not only work but also adapt and evolve through data.

Having also worked as an educator, I have developed strong communication and collaboration skills, enabling me to thrive in multicultural and cross-functional teams while bridging the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.
