## Hi there 👋! I'm Valter Sales

## 💼 Summary

I am a Full Stack Developer with strong expertise in both backend engineering and advanced frontend/UI architecture, building scalable and high-performance applications end to end. My technical background combines robust backend design using Java (Spring Boot) and Python (FastAPI, AI services) with deep experience in modern UI development using Angular/AngularJS, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

On the backend, I design and implement RESTful APIs, microservices, and domain-driven architectures that prioritize maintainability, performance, and security. I have experience optimizing SQL/NoSQL databases, structuring clean domain models, implementing async processing, refining API contracts, and applying best practices such as clean architecture and modularization. I also work with cloud environments and CI/CD pipelines to ensure reliability and automation across deployments.

On the frontend, I work as a UI Architect, designing scalable UI platforms, building reusable Angular components, and contributing to design systems that enforce consistency and enable teams to move faster. I have experience with microfrontends, UI performance tuning, and applying deep knowledge of JavaScript internals and browser behavior to deliver smooth, efficient interfaces.

My work is strongly collaborative — I partner with design, product, and engineering teams to align technical decisions with user and business goals. My background as an educator enhances my ability to clearly communicate trade-offs, guide teams, and support architecture discussions.

I am also the co-creator and original architect of the Prompt Shield App, where I designed backend and middleware layers for secure anonymization workflows while also helping shape front-end components. This project reflects my commitment to creating ethical, reliable, and user-centered technology.
