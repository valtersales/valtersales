## Hi there 👋! I'm Valter Sales

## 💼 Summary

I am a Full Stack Developer with deep expertise in frontend UI engineering and backend architecture, building secure, scalable, and high-performance platforms. I combine strong backend development in Java (Spring Boot) and Python (FastAPI, Django, AI services) with advanced frontend architecture using AngularJS, Angular 2+, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

Frontend/UI Engineering – AngularJS & Angular 2+
I design component-based architectures, reusable UI libraries, and scalable front-end modules. My experience includes RxJS, Observables, routing, reactive forms, interceptors, AOT, lazy loading, microfrontends, state management patterns, and cross-browser compatibility. I focus on UI performance through bundle optimization, caching strategies, DOM optimization, Lighthouse/Web Vitals improvements, and memory/CPU profiling. I define UI engineering standards and contribute to design systems adopted across teams.

Backend & Architecture
I build and maintain REST APIs, microservices, domain-driven architectures, and secure backend workflows. I optimize SQL/NoSQL databases, API performance, caching, and authentication flows. I work with async processing, API gateways, CI/CD, Dockerized deployments, Git flow, PR reviews, and cloud environments. My work includes security-critical government systems, applying OWASP practices, encryption, secure coding, auditing, and data protection.

Algorithms & Problem-Solving
I apply strong foundations in algorithmic reasoning, complexity analysis, data structures, data processing pipelines, and performance tuning, supporting robust architecture decisions.

Product Engineering
I have long-term experience in product-based platforms, owning UI modules end-to-end and delivering continuous iterations based on user and stakeholder feedback. Examples include mission-critical electoral systems and the Prompt Shield App, where I architected backend/middleware logic and contributed to frontend components for secure LLM interactions.

## 🚀 Experience Highlights

- **Software Engineer** – Tribunal Superior Eleitoral - *2016 - now*  
As a tech leader, I have led software development teams responsible for delivering mission-critical electoral solutions. I designed and implemented robust systems using Java, Angular, and Python, with a strong focus on AI and data analysis to ensure secure and efficient electoral processes. I coordinated cross-functional collaboration, aligning business goals with technical delivery, and consistently promoted best practices in code quality, software architecture, and agile methodologies.

- **University Professor** – UniCEUB - *1,5 years*  
I lectured undergraduate students in Java programming and software engineering, developing comprehensive curricula and practical assignments to enhance their problem-solving and coding skills. Beyond classroom instruction, I also mentored students on real-world applications of software development, bridging the gap between academic learning and professional practice.

- **Senior Softwae Engineer** – CESAR (Innovation Institute) - *1,2 years*  
I delivered innovative software solutions using Java, with an emphasis on scalable architectures and long-term system maintainability. I also collaborated with multidisciplinary teams in research and development projects, contributing to the design and implementation of advanced technical solutions.
